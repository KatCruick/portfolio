This is regular text.

:::full-width

This text should be wrapped in the SectionTextFullWidth component automatically!

No manual imports needed - the remark plugin handles it.

:::

More regular text after the directive.

## Testing with Props and Auto-Import

:::text-left{image="../../assets/01-coach/project-problem.png" imageAlt="Auto-imported image!" imageHeight="360"}

This content should appear on the left with an image on the right!

The image is automatically imported by the Remark plugin - no manual import needed!
