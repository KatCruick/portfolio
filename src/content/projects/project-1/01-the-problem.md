Health and fitness applications typically employ persuasive strategies to encourage the formation of healthy habits. Although persuasive strategies contribute to healthy behaviours, it is unclear what strategies are most appropriate for fitness applications aimed at helping users to schedule and record their physical activity, with the goal of changing or maintaining fitness behaviours. Further, the usability and user experience of applications that employ particular persuasive strategies is unknown.

This presents a problem, as the choice of persuasive design may negatively impact behavioural change and as such, work in opposition to the goal of the application. Additionally, the choice could impact the usability and user experience of the application, making is less attractive to users, resulting in user disengagement.
